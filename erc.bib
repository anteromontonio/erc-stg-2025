  abstract  = {Permutation groups, their fundamental theory and applications are discussed in this introductory book. It focuses on those groups that are most useful for studying symmetric structures such as graphs, codes and designs. Modern treatments of the O'Nan–Scott theory are presented not only for primitive permutation groups but also for the larger families of quasiprimitive and innately transitive groups, including several classes of infinite permutation groups. Their precision is sharpened by the introduction of a cartesian decomposition concept. This facilitates reduction arguments for primitive groups analogous to those, using orbits and partitions, that reduce problems about general permutation groups to primitive groups. The results are particularly powerful for finite groups, where the finite simple group classification is invoked. Applications are given in algebra and combinatorics to group actions that preserve cartesian product structures. Students and researchers with an interest in mathematical symmetry will find the book enjoyable and useful.},

  abstract = {A 3-orbit polyhedron is one in which the automorphism group has exactly 3 orbits on the set of incident triples (vertex, edge, face). Examples of such polyhedra are the prisms over regular n-gons as well as 5 of the Archimedean Solids. There are three classes of 3-orbit polyhedra, depending of the local configuration of their flags. In this paper, for each of the three classes, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on a set of generators of a group \$\${\textbackslash}Gamma \$\$so that there exists a polyhedron \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{P\}\}({\textbackslash}Gamma )\$\$such that \$\${\textbackslash}Gamma \$\$acts by automorphisms with 3-flag orbits, in the given class. The techniques used to do this combine the ideas of coset geometries used to construct regular and chiral polytopes, together with voltage assignments used on the so-called symmetry type graph of the constructed polyhedra. These twists to the classical techniques shed light on a possible way to generalize our results to polytopes of any rank and any number of orbits on flags (in fact, to polytopes of any possible symmetry type graph). Finally, we use the results obtained in the paper to show that, for any given class, almost all symmetric groups are the automorphism group of a 3-orbit polyhedron in that class.},

  abstract = {An abstract polytope is a combinatorial object that generalises geometric structures such as convex polytopes, tilings, maps on surfaces, among others. All such structures present an inductive nature: a polygon can be regarded as a family of line segments glued along their endpoints; a polyhedron can be understood as a family of polygons glued along their edges; a tiling of the space can be thought as a family of polyhedra glued along their faces, an so on. This inductive nature is still present in the abstract notion of a polytope and rises the \emph{extension problem}. Given an abstract polytope $\cK$, does there exist an abstract polytope $\cP$ such that all the maximal facets of $\cP$ are isomorphic to $\cK$? In this work we explore the problem when strong symmetry conditions are imposed to $\cP$. In particular, we show some original construction of chiral extensions in the situation when $\cK$ is a tilling with cubes of the $n$-dimensional torus.},

Chiral polytopes are those abstract polytopes that admit full combinatorial rotational symmetry but do not admit reflections. In this paper we build chiral polytopes whose facets (maximal faces) are isomorphic to a prescribed regular cubic tessellation of the $n$-dimensional torus ($n \geq 2$). As a consequence, we prove that for every $d \geq 3$ there exist infinitely many chiral $d$-polytopes.},

  abstract    = {We consider the problem of constructing an abstract $(n+1)$-polytope $Q$ with $k$ facets isomorphic to a given $n$-polytope $P$, where $k \geq 3$. In particular, we consider the case where we want $Q$ to be $(n-2,n)$-flat, meaning that every $(n-2)$-face is incident to every $n$-face (facet). We show that if $P$ admits such a flat extension for a given $k$, then the facet graph of $P$ is $(k-1)$-colorable. Conversely, we show that if the facet graph is $(k-1)$-colorable and $k-1$ is prime, then $P$ admits a flat extension for that $k$. We also show that if $P$ is facet-bipartite, then for every even $k$, there is a flat extension $P|k$ such that every automorphism of $P$ extends to an automorphism of $P|k$. Finally, if $P$ is a facet-bipartite $n$-polytope and $Q$ is a vertex-bipartite $m$-polytope, we describe a flat amalgamation of $P$ and $Q$, an $(m+n-1)$-polytope that is $(n-2,n)$-flat, with $n$-faces isomorphic to $P$ and co-$(n-2)$-faces isomorphic to $Q$.},

  abstract = {An algebraic map is a pair (G, Ω), where G is a group generated by x, y, with x2 = 1, acting transitively on a set Ω. It is regular if its automorphism group is transitive on Ω. Out of an algebraic map we can construct a topological map which is a two-cell decomposition of an orientable surface. There has been a lot of work on regular maps; on the sphere, for example, they are the Platonic solids. In this paper we show how we can construct a topological hypermap out of an algebraic hypermap. We put particular emphasis on the regular ones. On the sphere they are Archimedean solids and we also describe all examples on a torus and on a surface of genus 2.},

  abstract  = {“Polyhedron” means different things to different people. There is very little in common between the meaning of the word in topology and in geometry. But even if we confine attention to geometry of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space-as we shall do from now on -“polyhedron” can mean either a solid (as in “Platonic solids”, convex polyhedron, and other contexts), or a surface (such as the polyhedral models constructed from cardboard using “nets”, which were introduced by Albrecht Dürer [[17]] in 1525, or, in a more modern version, by Aleksandrov [[1]]), or the 1-dimensional complex consisting of points (“vertices”) and line-segments (“edges”) organized in a suitable way into polygons (“faces”) subject to certain restrictions (“skeletal polyhedra”, diagrams of which have been presented first by Luca Pacioli [[44]] in 1498 and attributed to Leonardo da Vinci). The last alternative is the least usual one-but it is close to what seems to be the most useful approach to the theory of general polyhedra. Indeed, it does not restrict faces to be planar, and it makes possible to retrieve the other characterizations in circumstances in which they reasonably apply: If the faces of a “surface” polyhedron are simple polygons, in most cases the polyhedron is unambiguously determined by the boundary circuits of the faces. And if the polyhedron itself is without selfintersections, then the “solid” can be found from the faces. These reasons, as well as some others, seem to warrant the choice of our approach.},

This text, designed for undergraduate mathematics students, provides a gentle introduction to the highlights of elementary group theory. Written in an informal style, the material is divided into short sections each of which deals with an important result or a new idea. Throughout the book, the emphasis is placed on concrete examples, many of them geometrical in nature, so that finite rotation groups and the seventeen wallpaper groups are treated in detail alongside theoretical results such as Lagrange's theorem, the Sylow theorems, and the classification theorem for finitely generated abelian groups. A novel feature at this level is a proof of the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, using group actions on trees. There are more than three hundred exercises and approximately sixty illustrations to help develop the student's intuition.},

Any finite group which can be generated by elements x, y satisfying{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}x² = y³ = (xy)⁷ = 1{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}is called a {\textless}em{\textgreater}Hurwitz{\textless}/em{\textgreater}group, and gives rise to a compact Riemann surface of which it is a maximal automorphism group. The bulk of the thesis is devoted to showing that all but 64 of the alternating groups are Hurwitz.

Conway states that if Γ is arc-transitive and has valence d, then there are precisely d − 1 orbits of consistent cycles under the action of Aut(Γ). In this paper, we extend the definition of consistent cycles to those which admit a k-step rotation, and call them \$1øverk\$-consistent. We investigate \$1øverk\$-consistent cycles in view of their overlap. This provides a simple proof of the original Conway's theorem, as well as a generalization to orbits of \$1øverk\$-consistent cycles.

We investigate the interplay between the geometric, combinatorial, or algebraic properties of the polytope PGand the combinatorial or algebraic structure of the underlying graph G, focussing in particular on aspects of symmetry. Several such families of colorful polytopes are studied including examples derived from a Cayley graph, in particular the graphicahedra, as well as the flagadjacency polytopes and related monodromy polytopes associated with a given abstract polytope. The duals of certain families of colorful polytopes have been important in the topological study of colored triangulations and crystallization of manifolds.},

We present a novel classification of mathematical data and derive an extended set of FAIR requirements, which accomodate the special needs of math datasets. We summarize these as deep FAIR . Finally, we show a prototypical system infrastructure, which can realize deep FAIRness for one category (tabular data) of mathematical datasets.},

The main question of this paper is whether for a given reflexible map M one can decompose the map into a parallel product of two reflexible maps. This can be achieved if and only if the monodromy (or the automorphism) group of the map has at least two minimal normal subgroups. All reflexible maps up to 100 edges, which are not parallel-product decomposable, are calculated and presented. For this purpose, all degenerate and slightly-degenerate reflexible maps are classified.},

This paper continues our study of ‘alternating’ semiregular abstract polytopes. These structures have abstract regular facets, still with combinatorial automorphism group transitive on vertices and with two kinds of regular facets occurring in an alternating fashion. Here we investigate a parameter called the interlacing number k for a compatible pair of regular n-polytopes P and Q: in what circumstances can we have k copies each of P and Q occuring in alternating fashion as the facets of a semiregular (n+1)-polytope S?},

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {The main results of this article facilitate the search for quotients of regular abstract polytopes. A common approach in the study of abstract polytopes is to construct polytopes with specified facets and vertex figures. Any nonregular polytope \$\$ {\textbackslash}mathcal\{Q\} \$\$may be constructed as a quotient of a regular polytope \$\$ {\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\} \$\$by a (so-called) semisparse subgroup of its automorphism group W (which will be a string C-group). It becomes important, therefore, to be able to identify whether or not a given subgroup N of a string C-group W is semisparse. This article proves a number of properties of semisparse subgroups. These properties may be used to test for semisparseness in a way which is computationally more efficient than previous methods. The methods are used to find an example of a section regular polytope of type \{6, 3, 3\} whose facets are Klein bottles.},

  abstract = {Classical geometric and topological operations on polyhedra, maps and polytopes often give rise to structures with the same symmetry group as the original one, but with more flags. In this paper we introduce the notion of voltage operations on maniplexes, as a way to unify the study of such operations and generalize them to other geometric and combinatorial structures such as abstract polytopes, hypermaps, maniplexes or hypertopes. This can be done since our technique provides a way to study classical operations in a graph theoretic setting, and thus to apply a voltage operation one only needs that the combinatorial structure in hand can be understood as an n-valent properly n-edge colored graph. For example, in the case of abstract polytopes, the partial order can be encoded into the so-called flag graph of the polytope and the voltage operation is therefore applied to such flag graph to then be recovered as a partial order. We focus on studying the interactions between voltage operations and the symmetries of the operated object, and show that these operations can be potentially used to build maniplexes with prescribed symmetry type graphs. Moreover, a complete characterization of when an operation can be seen as a voltage operation is given.},

The motion of A acting on X is defined as the largest integer k such that all non-trivial elements of A move at least k elements of X. The Motion Lemma of Russell and Sundaram states that if the motion is at least 2 log2{\textbar}A{\textbar}, then the action has distinguishing number two. When X is a vector space, group, or map, the Motion Lemma and elementary estimates of the motion together show that in all but finitely many cases, the action of Aut(X) on X has distinguishing number two. A new lower bound for the motion of any transitive action gives similar results for transitive actions with restricted point-stabilizers. As an instance of what can happen with intransitive actions, it is shown that if X is a set of points on a closed surface of genus g, and {\textbar}X{\textbar} is sufficiently large with respect to g, then any action on X by a finite group of surface homeomorphisms has distinguishing number two.},

We give an example where this fails. We partially repair the conjecture by showing that when "enough motion occurs," the distinguishing number does indeed decay.  Specifically, defining m(G)=minϕ∈Aut(G)ϕ≠id{\textbar}\{v∈G:ϕ(v)≠v\}{\textbar},m(G)=minϕ∈Aut(G)ϕ≠id{\textbar}\{v∈G:ϕ(v)≠v\}{\textbar}, \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\} \}(G) = {\textbackslash}min\_\{\{{\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Aut\}(G)\} {\textbackslash}atop \{{\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}neq {\textbackslash}mathbf\{id\}\}\} {\textbar}{\textbackslash}\{v {\textbackslash}in G {\textbackslash};:{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}phi(v) {\textbackslash}neq v{\textbackslash}\}{\textbar},  we show that when m(G){\textgreater}2log2{\textbar}Aut(G){\textbar}m(G){\textgreater}2log2⁡{\textbar}Aut(G){\textbar}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}(G) {\textgreater} 2{\textbackslash}log\_2 {\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Aut\}(G){\textbar}, GGG is 2-distinguishable.

There has been considerable interest in the computational complexity of the ddd-distinguishability problem. Specifically, there has been much musing on the computational complexity of the language \{(G,d):G is d-distinguishable\}.\{(G,d):G is d-distinguishable\}. {\textbackslash}\{(G, d){\textbackslash}; : {\textbackslash}; G {\textbackslash}text\{ is \$d\$-distinguishable\}{\textbackslash}\}.

  abstract  = {Voltage operations extend traditional geometric and combinatorial operations (such as medial, truncation, prism, and pyramid over a polytope) to operations on maniplexes, maps, polytopes, and hypertopes.
In classical operations, the symmetries of the original object remain in the operated one, but sometimes additional symmetries are created; the same situation arises with voltage operations.
We characterise the automorphisms of the operated object that are derived from the original one and use this to bound the number of flag orbits (under the action of the automorphism group) of the operated object in terms of the original one.
The conditions under which the automorphism group of the original object is the same as the automorphism group of the operated object are given.
We also look at the cases where there is additional symmetry, which can be accurately described due to the symmetries of the operation itself.},

  abstract   = {polytopes generalize the classical notion of convex polytopes to more general combinatorial structures. The most studied ones are regular and chiral polytopes, as it is well-known, they can be constructed as coset geometries from their automorphism groups. This is also known to be true for 2- and 3-orbit 3-polytopes. In this paper we show that every abstract n-polytope can be constructed as a coset geometry. This construction is done by giving a characterization, in terms of generators, relations and intersection conditions, of the automorphism group of a k-orbit polytope with given symmetry type graph. Furthermore, we use these results to show that for all k≠2, there exist k-orbit n-polytopes with Boolean automorphism groups, for all n≥3.},

Until recently, very few examples of chiral d-polytopes with rank d≥5 were known. In this paper we extend a construction for chiral 4-polytopes (with tetrahedral facets) to produce two infinite families of chiral d-polytopes with simplex facets, for every integer d≥5. Specifically, we show that for every d≥5, there exists a chiral d-polytope with automorphism group isomorphic to the alternating group An and a chiral d-polytope with automorphism group isomorphic to the symmetric group Sn, for all but finitely many n. In each case the facets are simplices, and the vertex-figures are chiral. Our extended construction can also be modified to produce four families of regular d-polytopes with simplices as facets, and automorphism groups isomorphic to An, Sn, An×C2 and Sn×C2 for all but finitely many n.},

  abstract = {If G is a transitive group of degree n having a string C-group of rank r≥(n+3)/2, then G is necessarily the symmetric group Sn. We prove that if n is large enough, up to isomorphism and duality, the number of string C-groups of rank r for Sn (with r≥(n+3)/2) is the same as the number of string C-groups of rank r+1 for Sn+1. This result and the tools used in its proof, in particular the rank and degree extension, imply that if one knows the string C-groups of rank (n+3)/2 for Sn with n odd, one can construct from them all string C-groups of rank (n+3)/2+k for Sn+k for any positive integer k. The classification of the string C-groups of rank r≥(n+3)/2 for Sn is thus reduced to classifying string C-groups of rank r for S2r−3. A consequence of this result is the complete classification of all string C-groups of Sn with rank n−κ for κ∈\{1,…,7\}, when n≥2κ+3, which extends previously known results. The number of string C-groups of rank n−κ, with n≥2κ+3, of this classification gives the following sequence of integers indexed by κ and starting at κ=1:(1,1,7,9,35,48,135) This sequence of integers is new according to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It is available as sequence number A359367.},
