\subsection*{Proposal Summary:}
% Proposal summary (identical to the abstract from the online proposal submission forms, section 1). 

% The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with a clear understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be achieved. The abstract will be used as the short description of your research proposal in the evaluation process and in communications to contact in particular potential  independent external experts and/or to inform the Commission and/or the programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies. It must therefore be short and precise and should not contain confidential information. 

% Please use plain typed text, avoiding formulae and other special characters. The abstract must be written in English. There is a limit of 2000 characters (spaces and line breaks included).

% Explain and justify the cross-panel or cross domain nature of your proposal, if a secondary panel is indicated in the online proposal submission forms. There is a limit of 1000 characters (spaces and line breaks included).
