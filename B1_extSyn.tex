\section*{Section a: \textit{Extended Synopsis of the scientific proposal}}

\cite{Montero2018_RegularPolyhedra3,Montero2018_RegularPolyhedra3}
% [The Extended Synopsis should give a concise presentation of the scientific proposal, with particular attention to the ground-breaking nature of the research project, which will allow evaluation panels to assess, in Step 1 of the evaluation, the feasibility of the outlined scientific approach. Describe the proposed work in the context of the state of the art of the field. It is important that the extended synopsis contains minimum information relevant to the evaluation criteria, since the Step 1 panel will have access only to part B1. 
% References to literature should also be included. Please use a reference style that is commonly used in your discipline such as American Chemical Society (ACS) style, American Medical Association (AMA) style, Modern Language Association (MLA) style, etc. and that allows the evaluators to easily retrieve each reference.]
